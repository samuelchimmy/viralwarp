                ViralWarp was born from a simple conversation on Farcaster. Our founder (@508) was struggling with visibility on the platform
                and reached out to Farcaster founder Dan Romero (dwr.eth) about the challenges new users face:
              </p>
              
              <div className="border-l-4 border-warp-purple pl-4 my-6 py-2">
                <p className="italic text-muted-foreground mb-2">
                  "Am I shadowbanned? Where can I learn about farcaster visibility algorithm? I seem to be the only one reading my casts. 
                  It would be nice if the team can work on an algorithm that gives new casters some visibility to grow audience if they are consistent."
                </p>

              </div>
              
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                The response was honest but highlighted a real problem:
              </p>
              
              <div className="border-l-4 border-warp-purple pl-4 my-6 py-2">
                <p className="italic text-muted-foreground mb-2">
                  "You're not shadow banned. You have 33 followers. Not many people are going to see your casts unfortunately."
                </p>
                <p className="text-sm text-right">- dwr.eth (Dan Romero)</p>
              </div>
              
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                This led to the fundamental question that sparked ViralWarp:
              </p>
              
              <div className="border-l-4 border-warp-purple pl-4 my-6 py-2">
                <p className="italic text-muted-foreground mb-2">
                  "How do I grow my followers? Can I get a viral moment?"
                </p>
                <p className="text-sm text-right">- @508</p>
              </div>
              
              <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                That's when the idea struck: what if we could create a platform where Farcaster users could help each other grow? 
                What if users with larger audiences could provide value to newer users, and be fairly compensated for their time and social capital?
                ViralWarp was created to solve this exact problem - democratizing visibility on Farcaster and creating win-win opportunities 
                for both established and emerging creators.
